# Cyber-Physical-Systems
This repository contains code developed over a twelve week period to program a drone to
various specifications. We used the Air:bit drone, which can be programmed in Python using an on-board
micro-controller called a Micro:bit. Flying the drone requires the use of two Micro:bits - one acts
as a controller and the other is attached to the drone itself. Flying the drone involves writing
commands from the Micro:bit on the drone to an attached flight control board.
